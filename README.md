## Purpose
Game written in python. I  have written it to learn object oriented programming.

You need to have Python 3.6 or newer with pygame liberary. To start game just run main.py

## How to play

You play as a ninja and you try to not fall down.

Press and hold left mouse button to throw shuriken with a rope. Aim to red  Release this button to cut the rope.

Click right mouse button to throw shuriken to kill your enemys.

If you are flying (you are not swaying on the rope) you can click W to jump.

If you are swaying on the rope use W/S to extend/shorten the rope.

Additionaly you can use U/I to make game faster/slower.
